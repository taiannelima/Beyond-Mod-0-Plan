# My daily-basis routine  🌟

Dear Team, 

This is my  balance between professional commitments and personal well-being. I don't have week days or weekends. Everyday I do the exact same routine. I may add an exception for shopping (groceries) or seeing a friend, a rare event, actually! 

## 6:30-7am AM - Morning  ☀️

The day starts at 6:30 am. (I also have business in Brazil so I have a 4/5 hour timezone.)
I wake up, freshen up, I take a shower and I feed my dog.

## 7:15 AM - Morning Dok/Walk and Reflection 🚶‍♂️

At 7:15  Not only serves as physical exercise but also offers a quiet moment and quality time with my dog, both for reflection and mental preparation.

## 7:30 AM - Workspace Organization 📇

Returning by 7:30 am, my time is to organizing the workspace. Also some time for cleaning, like dishes, laundry.

## 7:30 AM - 11:30/12:30 PM - Work/study Focus 💼

The period from 7:30 am to noon is dedicated to focused work and studying.

## 11:30 PM - Brunch Break 🍽️

I break my fast at 11/12. I take one hour off, I cook my own food. If im too caught up w worlk, I order something from almost the same resto everytime. Its what I know, I know how they work, quality of it, and its easier. 

## 12:30 PM - 4:00 PM - Afternoon Productivity 🖥️

Resuming work/studying. 

## 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM

I feed my dog, walking him again for his necessities, and I get prepared for my 30 min Bible studying.

## 5:00 - 5:30 PM - Bible Studying

This is the highlight of my day.

## 6:00  🌐

I review my tasks, notes, work or homework for the next day, I make sure I'm caught up and ready with everything.


## Post-6 ish pm

I some quality time with family, friends, workout, social media, news, etc..

## 8:00 PM - Evening Routine 🚿

At 8 pm, I shower and get ready to wind down and watch something on tv, usually a movie, series, or documentary.

## 10:00 PM - Nighttime Preparations 🌙

By 10 pm I'm ready to sleep, and prepared to restart my day all over again. 

This works for me from Mon-Mon. Some exceptions may happen, but mainly, this is my routine.
